Therefore, DexTechnologies OГњ relies on data analysis as a risk-assessment and suspicion detection tool. DexTechnologies OГњ performs a variety of compliance-related tasks, including capturing data, filtering, record-keeping, investigation management, and reporting. System functionalities include: <br>1) Daily check of Users against recognized вЂњblack listsвЂќ (e.g. OFAC), aggregating transfers by multiple data points, placing Users on watch and service denial lists, opening cases for investigation where needed, sending internal communications and filling out statutory reports, if applicable; <br>2) Case and document management. <br>With regard to the AML/KYC Policy, DexTechnologies OГњ will monitor all transactions and it reserves the right to: ensure that transactions of suspicious nature are reported to the proper law enforcement through the Compliance Officer; <br>request the User to provide any additional information and documents in case of suspicious transactions; suspend or terminate UserвЂ™s Account when DexTechnologies OГњ has reasonable suspicion that such User engaged in illegal activity. <br>The above list is not exhaustive and the Compliance Officer will monitor UsersвЂ™ transactions on a day-to-day basis in order to define whether such transactions are to be reported and treated as suspicious or are to be treated as bona fide. </p>
